 * Created by User on 4/11/2015.
 *
 * This screen will display the words "Defeat" and prompt the user to replay
 *
 * Note: Not completed. I don't have any of the assets prepared for this screen, but since this
 * project is meant to be a learning experience and I am sure that I can get this screen to work
 * without too much issue, I  will save completing this screen for later in the project.
